this program provides function to map 3D positions of kinect skeleton points to
joint rotation angles.

skeleton points (8): right_shoulder, left_shoulder, left_hip, elbow, wrist, hand, thumb, handtip
each points should be the the form of 1 by 2 numpy array

joint rotations (7): shoulder_yaw, shoulder_pitch, shoulder_roll, elbow_pitch, elbow_roll, hand_yaw, wrist_yaw
each rotation value is a scalar
